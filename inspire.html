        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Ghandi is known for being a nonviolent man. He was admit that members of the Hindu and Muslim faith should learn to get along and planned to do this internally. Ghandi eventually died for his cause when he was murdered on his way to a prayer service.</p>
